## Message from Developer

I know that the Internet is filled with unlimited resources, and blogs already. I want to showcase the hidden talent that us Gen Z folks have and often tend to undermine it, I want them to touch the hearts of hundreds if not thousands of struggling souls who are out there in need of kind words/motivation/passion/understanding life by the means of short stories/blogs/poems :)

I hope the posts here will stand out.
Thank You :)

Aayush Mishra.
